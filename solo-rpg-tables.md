## EXAMPLE ODDS

| ODDS | DESCRIPTION | "IS THE CREATURE HOSTILE?" | "WILL THIS ABANDONED CAR START?" | "DOES THE GUARD HELP US?" |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Certain** | You're as sure as you can be | It's stated intent to destroy us and looks ready | It was driven here just a moment ago | He is an ally, pursuing same goals as us |
| **Nearly Certain** | Quite sure, but some doubt | We've been fighting this thing all day | We saw it operating a few hours ago | He's helped us before and is sympathetic |
| **Very Likely** | Quite likely, though far from sure | It's armed, angry, and actively threatening | Signs of recent use, looks in good shape | We're on the same team, of course he'll help |
| **Likely** | Slightly more likely than 50/50 | It's armed and angry | Appears to be in working order | He seems to be on our side. I think? |
| **50/50** | Can go either way, or no idea | It's a new encounter, we'll have to see | We just found this vehicle. Maybe it works? | You don't know whose side he's on. Cross fingers |
| **Unlikely** | Slightly less likely than 50/50 | It's unarmed and uninterested in us | The vehicle looks a little rough | He hasn't been too friendly |
| **Very Unlikely** | Quite unlikely, but possible | It looks docile, doesn't mind our presence | It's a mess, hasn't moved in a while | He's been hostile, doubt he'd risk helping us |
| **Nearly Impossible** | There might still be a chance | We've seen these before, all been peaceful | Lots of visible damage and is a mess | This guy is doing his job, doesn't care |
| **Impossible** | There's no way, unless I'm wrong | These have always been peaceful, seems tame | This is a wreck, would be a miracle | He's a true believer in our enemy |

|------|-------------|

| EVENT FOCUS | WHEN TO CHOOSE |
|-------------|----------------|
| Remote Event | PC expecting news from afar |
| Ambiguous Event | Adventure has slowed, ready for mystery |
| New NPC | Logical reason for new Character to appear |
| NPC Action | PC waiting on NPC actions to move forward |
| NPC Negative/Positive | Want to shift focus onto an NPC |
| Move Toward Thread | Adventure stalled, needs push forward |
| Move Away/PC Negative | Want new challenge for PC |
| PC Positive | PC having hard time, could use a break |
| Close Thread | Adventure complicated, thin out Threads |
| Current Context | Event could help explain Fate result, or would be disruptive otherwise |

## FATE QUESTIONS AS RPG RULES

When using Fate Questions to replace RPG mechanics:

| ELEMENT | APPROACH |
|---------|----------|
| **Chaos Factor** | Treat as 5 regardless of actual value |
| **Exceptional Results** | Treat as regular Yes/No if rule doesn't have degrees of success |
| **Random Events** | Ignore unless the rule has similar mechanics |
