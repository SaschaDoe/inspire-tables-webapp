They ask you to help overthrow a \r\nrival faction or leader.  This is a major undertaking, and may \r\nbe the work of several sub-quests in order to execute; \r\n  \r\n1d4+2 such, if you wish to randomize it.  The culmination \r\nof these efforts will be to destabilize and eradicate the \r\nrival, and to solidify the importance and influence of the \r\npatron.  Whether the methods to be employed are strictly \r\nlegal, whether the rival faction might try to eradicate those \r\nwho would eradicate them, and what the patron’s ultimate \r\nmotives are can be variable.\r\n  Quest Development\r\nIn order to progress with an active quest, you may \r\nintentionally destroy another.

None of the monsters or NPCs involved in this \r\nnew iteration has any memory of you or the events having \r\nhappened before, and no object or part of the not-so-new \r\nscenario bears any evidence that you faced it before.\r\nCombat\r\nOutcome\r\n  Maneuver\r\nTargeting\r\n  Frontline\r\nRole\r\n  Skirmisher\r\nRole Size\r\n  Mindless\r\nStance\r\n  Overwhelmed\r\nQuest & Encounter\r\n  New Quest\r\nEach time your patron attempts a solution to a problem, \r\nit works only as a short-term fix; the issue occurs again \r\nwithin a fortnight, in some cases worse than before.  There’s \r\nsomething that is behind the events, something that must \r\nbe driving the repetition.  This could be a nefarious third \r\nparty that resupplies or encourages the activity; it could be \r\nthat natural environmental conditions cause the recursion \r\nsuch as the weather, migratory or mating patterns; maybe \r\nthe pattern is societal, driven by systemic factors such as \r\ntax rates or immigration; perhaps a faction makes it their \r\nmission or part thereof to cause the events; or it could be \r\nsimple random chance.\r\n  Quest Development\r\nThe last \r\n  1d3 stages of an active quest must be achieved \r\nonce again in order to proceed.\r\n  Reward\r\nA pendant of onyx.  Pressing it as a standard action \r\ncauses a bubble of 20’ around you; creatures within that \r\nbubble repeat their entire last round.  Spells or abilities \r\nthat extinguish or are otherwise limited by uses per day \r\nautomatically happen without additional hits against those \r\ntotals or expenditures; ammunition is not expended again; \r\nand charges or other factors are not reduced.  Hits hit and \r\nmiss as they did last round, but damage is rolled anew.  This \r\naffects an entire round of combat for those in the bubble: \r\nenemies and allies alike, if such are present.  Those within \r\nthe bubble who affected or targeted things outside the \r\nbubble last round still do so; spells and weapons may extend \r\nor move outside the boundary.  The pendant’s magic is good \r\nfor a single use.\r\n  Penalty\r\nThe first time the majority of enemy attacks successfully \r\nhit in a round of their combat, they activate an artifact \r\nsimilar to the one described in Reward: All those enemies \r\nwho successfully hit the party receive another free round \r\nof combat, wherein their attacks hit as before, and their \r\nabilities function once again without reduction or penalty.\r\nQuest\r\nArchetype\r\n  Complex\r\nSub\r\n      1d4+1 Sequential\r\n52"

This leader has half \r\nagain the hit points of their comrades, and gains \r\n  \r\nadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

They greet you, and invite \r\nyour help in the upcoming battle, which they warn is \r\nimminent.  If you refuse, they look down upon you, but \r\nunless given a reason for further hostilities, they’re on their \r\nway.

The nature of the tasks \r\nis unsavory, or you need to be seen as uninvolved.  This \r\ncould all be related to a grander purpose, or simply to one or \r\nmore other active quests.  Finding hirelings, securing their \r\ndiscreetness, and ensuring they follow through and are not \r\nbought out by a higher bidder, are the objectives here.\r\n  Quest Development\r\nIt turns out that your obstacles and challenges have been \r\ncarefully orchestrated by a behind-the-scenes villain who has \r\nbeen working against your objectives all of this time.
