# TV Tropes Mapping TODO

This document tracks which tropes need to be mapped to their actual TV Tropes URLs.

## How to Use This

1. Search for the trope on https://tvtropes.org
2. Find the correct page name (e.g., "MissionFromGod" for "mission from higher power")
3. Add the mapping to `src/lib/data/tvTropesMapping.ts`
