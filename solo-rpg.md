# Mythic Game Master Emulator 2nd Edition - Rules Summary

## Overview
Mythic GME is a system that replaces a live Game Master with mechanics that emulate creative decision-making, allowing solo or GM-less group play.

## Core Concepts

### What You Need
- 2d10 (for percentile rolls 1-100)
- d4, d6, d8 for rolling on Lists
- Adventure Lists sheet
- Adventure Journal sheet

### Key Terms
- **Chaos Factor (CF)**: Value 1-9 measuring PC control over events. Starts at 5.
- **Threads**: Goals and missions the PC pursues (tracked on Threads List)
- **Characters**: Important NPCs and active elements (tracked on Characters List)
- **Context**: Everything that has happened so far in the adventure
- **Scenes**: Discrete units of narrative time and action

## 1. FATE QUESTIONS

### When to Ask
Ask when you're unsure what happens next or need to test an expectation during moments of narrative tension.

### How It Works
1. **Pose a Yes/No Question** based on your expectations
2. **Assign Odds** of getting a Yes answer:
   - Impossible → Nearly Impossible → Very Unlikely → Unlikely → 50/50 → Likely → Very Likely → Nearly Certain → Certain
3. **Cross-reference Odds with Chaos Factor** on the Fate Chart
4. **Roll 1d100** and compare to the percentage
5. **Interpret the answer**: Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, or Exceptional No

### Four Possible Answers
- **Yes**: Your expectation is confirmed
- **Exceptional Yes**: Your expectation + more (roll ≤ lower 20% of Yes range)
- **No**: Next most expected outcome
- **Exceptional No**: Opposite of Yes, intensified (roll ≥ top value shown)

### Random Events
If you roll doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.) AND the single digit ≤ Chaos Factor, a Random Event occurs.

### Fate Check (Alternative Method)
Instead of using the Fate Chart:
1. Roll 2d10 and add them together
2. Apply modifiers based on Odds and Chaos Factor
3. 11+ = Yes, 10 or less = No
4. 18-20 = Exceptional Yes, 2-4 = Exceptional No
5. Doubles where single digit ≤ CF = Random Event

### Using Fate Questions as RPG Rules
When replacing RPG mechanics:
- Treat Chaos Factor as 5 (ignore actual CF)
- Consider treating Exceptional results as regular answers
- May ignore Random Events from these rolls

## 2. CHAOS FACTOR

### What It Does
- Represents how much control PCs have over events
- Higher CF = more Yes answers, more Random Events, more Scene changes
- Lower CF = more No answers, fewer surprises

### Starting Value
Begins at 5 for new adventures

### Adjusting the Chaos Factor
At the end of each Scene:
- **Increase by 1** if the Scene was chaotic and out of PC control
- **Decrease by 1** if the PC was mostly in control
- Never goes below 1 or above 9

## 3. RANDOM EVENTS

### When They Occur
1. When asking a Fate Question (roll doubles ≤ CF)
2. When starting an Interrupt Scene

### Generating Random Events

#### Step 1: Context
Consider everything that's happened so far, including the Fate Question or Scene that triggered it.

#### Step 2: Event Focus (roll 1d100)
- 1-5: Remote Event
- 6-10: Ambiguous Event
- 11-20: New NPC
- 21-40: NPC Action (roll on Characters List)
- 41-45: NPC Negative (roll on Characters List)
- 46-50: NPC Positive (roll on Characters List)
- 51-55: Move Toward A Thread (roll on Threads List)
- 56-65: Move Away From A Thread (roll on Threads List)
- 66-70: Close A Thread (roll on Threads List)
- 71-80: PC Negative
- 81-85: PC Positive
- 86-100: Current Context

**Choosing vs Rolling**: You can choose the Event Focus instead of rolling when it makes narrative sense.

#### Step 3: Event Meaning
Roll on Meaning Tables to get two words for inspiration:
- **Actions Tables**: For what someone/something is doing
- **Descriptions Tables**: For what something looks like
- **Elements Tables**: Themed tables (Locations, Characters, Objects, etc.)

Choose the table that best fits the Context. Roll 1d100 twice on your chosen table(s).

#### Step 4: Interpretation
Combine Context + Event Focus + Event Meaning to create the Random Event.

## 4. LISTS

### Threads List
- Record PC goals, missions, and quests
- Add/remove during Scene Bookkeeping or as they occur
- Used when Random Events reference Threads

### Characters List
- Record important NPCs, locations, groups, objects, events
- Can include anything that acts independently
- Add/remove during Scene Bookkeeping or as they occur
- Used when Random Events reference NPCs

### List Structure
- 25 lines total, divided into 5 sections of 5 lines
- Roll dice based on active sections to select elements
- Empty lines = "Choose" (pick an element or reroll)

### Rolling on Lists
- **1-5 elements**: Roll d10 only
- **6-10 elements**: Roll d4 for section, then d10 for line
- **11-15 elements**: Roll d6 for section, then d10 for line
- **16-20 elements**: Roll d8 for section, then d10 for line
- **21-25 elements**: Roll d10 for section, then d10 for line

## 5. SCENES

### Scene Types
1. **First Scene**: Opens the adventure
2. **Expected Scene**: Starts as you expect (roll above CF on d10)
3. **Altered Scene**: Modified version of Expected (roll odd ≤ CF on d10)
4. **Interrupt Scene**: Completely different (roll even ≤ CF on d10)

### Scene Structure

#### 1. Prepare Lists
Set up Threads and Characters Lists (can pre-populate with ideas)

#### 2. Create First Scene
Four methods:
- **Inspired Idea**: Use your own concept
- **Random Event**: Generate Event Focus + Meaning
- **Meaning Tables**: Roll word pairs for inspiration
- **4W Method**: Roll for Who, What, Where, Why

#### 3. Subsequent Scenes
1. **Determine Expected Scene**: Decide how you think it will start
2. **Test Against Chaos Factor**:
   - Roll d10
   - Above CF = Expected Scene occurs
   - Odd ≤ CF = Altered Scene
   - Even ≤ CF = Interrupt Scene

#### 4. Play Out the Scene
- Use Fate Questions to answer uncertainties
- Follow your expectations between Questions
- Apply RPG rules if using a chosen system
- Random Events can occur from Fate Questions

#### 5. End Scene Bookkeeping
- Update Threads List (add/remove goals)
- Update Characters List (add/remove NPCs)
- Adjust Chaos Factor (up if chaotic, down if controlled)
- Update Adventure Journal

### When to Start/End Scenes
Multiple strategies:
- **Interest**: Start when something interesting begins, end when resolved
- **Time/Location**: Based on changes in time or place
- **Narrative Shift**: When focus changes
- **Mood**: When you feel it's time
- **Automatic Interrupt**: Generate Random Event when stuck

### Altered Scenes
The Expected Scene changes. Methods to create:
- **Next Expectation**: What would happen instead?
- **A Tweak**: Change one element (Character, activity, object, location)
- **Fate Question**: Ask what changes
- **Meaning Tables**: Roll for inspiration
- **Scene Adjustment Table**: Roll d10 for specific change type

### Interrupt Scenes
Generate like a Random Event:
1. Roll Event Focus (or choose Move Toward A Thread)
2. Roll Event Meaning
3. Interpret in Context

## 6. MEANING TABLES

### Three Main Types
1. **Actions**: Active narrative elements (what's happening)
2. **Descriptions**: Descriptive elements (what things look like)
3. **Elements**: Themed, specific tables

### Elements Meaning Tables
45+ specialized tables including:
- **Core**: Locations, Characters, Objects
- **Character-focused**: Appearance, Identity, Descriptors, Actions, Conversations, Background, Motivations
- **Setting-focused**: Caverns, Dungeons, Forests, Cities, etc.
- **Creature-focused**: Animal Actions, Creature Descriptors
- **Other**: Magic Effects, Scavenging, Traps, Plot Twists, Adventure Tone

### How to Use
- Roll 1d100 twice on chosen table
- Pair the two words for inspiration
- Can roll on multiple tables for more detail
- Trust your instincts and go beyond literal meanings

## 7. DISCOVERING MEANING

Use Meaning Tables anytime to add detail without a Fate Question:
- Character backgrounds and appearance
- NPC actions and motivations
- Scene details and descriptions
- Object properties
- Location features

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### Expectations & Interpretations
- Most play follows your expectations
- Test expectations with Fate Questions when uncertain
- Interpretations become narrative fact and new Context
- Limit to 1-2 Fate Questions per detail

### Asking Good Questions
- **Action-oriented**: "Are there zombies?" not "Is it clear?"
- **Guided by expectations**: Based on Context, not desires
- **Tension-building**: Ask hard questions that create drama
- **Avoid narrative-killing**: Don't end storylines prematurely

### Guidelines for Question Frequency
- Ask when genuinely uncertain
- Follow expectations between Questions
- One Question should be enough; two max for most situations
- Use all four possible answers (Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, Exceptional No)

## VARIATIONS & OPTIONS

### Chaos Flavors
Alternative Fate Charts with different Chaos influence levels:
- **Mid-Chaos**: Less extreme swings
- **Low-Chaos**: Minimal Chaos impact
- **No-Chaos**: Consistent percentages

### NPC Behavior
Roll on NPC Behavior Table when uncertain what an NPC does (separate mechanic covered in Variations chapter)

### Thread Progress Tracks
Optional system for tracking progress toward goals (Variations chapter)

### Keyed Scenes
Pre-plan scene sequences while allowing Mythic to add surprises (Variations chapter)

### Prepared Adventures
Use Mythic with published adventures (guidance in Variations chapter)
