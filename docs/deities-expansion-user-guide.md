# Lore Master's Deck: Deities Expansion - User Guide

## What is the Deities Expansion?

The **Deities Expansion** (also known as "Master of Gods") adds 60 new cards to the Lore Master's Deck system:

- **25 Deity cards**: Gods, spirits, deities, and cosmic entities
- **35 Expansion variant cards**: Special versions of the 7 core lore types that connect to deities

This expansion introduces a unique **deity-pairing mechanic** that creates compound names and deeper worldbuilding connections.

## How Deity-Pairing Works

### The Basic Concept

When you draw an **Expansion variant card**, you must also draw a **Deity card**. The deity's name replaces the special ⚪ (white circle) placeholder in the expansion card's cues, creating a compound name.

### Examples

**Example 1: Location + Deity**
- **Expansion Card**: "GATES OF ⚪"
- **Deity Card**: "THE TORCHBEARER"
- **Result**: "GATES OF THE TORCHBEARER"

**Example 2: Faction + Deity**
- **Expansion Card**: "⚪'S REAPERS"
- **Deity Card**: "THE LION"
- **Result**: "THE LION'S REAPERS"

**Example 3: Figure + Deity**
- **Expansion Card**: "⚪'S PARIAH"
- **Deity Card**: "THE DRAGON"
- **Result**: "THE DRAGON'S PARIAH"

### Why This Matters

The deity-pairing mechanic:
- **Adds depth**: Creates stronger thematic connections between different card types
- **Reduces ambiguity**: The deity name clarifies what the ⚪ symbol refers to in secondary cues
- **Encourages storytelling**: Automatically creates relationships between deities and worldly elements
- **Builds pantheons**: Helps establish a connected pantheon of gods and their influences

## Card Types in the Expansion

### Deity Cards

**Structure**:
- 4 Primary Cues (deity roles/titles)
- 1-4 Secondary Cues (the deity's name in "THE [NAME]" format)

**Examples**:
- Primary: REVELER, SMUDGER, RAVAGER, FRIEND
- Secondary: THE LION

- Primary: MINDFIRE, TITAN, NAVIGATOR, TORCHBEARER
- Secondary: THE SERPENT

**How to use**: Deity cards can be:
1. Paired with expansion variant cards (primary use)
2. Used as inspiration for creating gods in your world
3. Combined with other card types to define divine domains

### Expansion Variant Cards

These are special versions of the 7 core lore types (Faction, Figure, Event, Location, Object, Material, Creature) that include ⚪ placeholders for deity names.

**Identifying Expansion Cards**:
- Primary cues contain "⚪" or "OF ⚪" or "⚪'S"
- Secondary cues may also have ⚪ symbols

**Example Expansion Cards by Type**:

**Faction**: "⚪'S PIONEERS", "⚪'S RIDERS", "CHURCH OF ⚪"
**Figure**: "⚪'S PARIAH", "⚪'S ANOINTED", "AVATAR OF ⚪"
**Event**: "⚪'S ARRIVAL", "⚪'S REAPING", "BIRTH OR DEATH OF A DEITY ⚪"
**Location**: "CRADLE OF ⚪", "TEMPLE OF ⚪", "GATES OF ⚪"
**Object**: "⚪'S MEDALLION", "BLADE OF ⚪", "ORB OF ⚪"
**Material**: "⚪'S ALLOY", "NECTAR OF ⚪", "BLOOD OF ⚪"
**Creature**: "⚪'S ROSE", "HOUND OF ⚪", "ANGEL OF ⚪"

## Using the Expansion in the Storyboard

### Enabling Deities Expansion

1. Open the Lore Master's Deck generator
2. Look for the "Use Deities Expansion" checkbox
3. Enable it to draw expansion variant cards instead of base deck cards
4. When enabled, the system will automatically pair expansion cards with deity cards

### Reading Deity-Paired Cards

When a card is paired with a deity, you'll see:
- The original cue with ⚪ replaced by the deity name
- A visual indicator (🌟) showing the card is deity-paired
- Hovering shows both the card and its paired deity

### Example Cluster with Deities

**Center Card** (Faction - Expansion):
- Primary: "THE SERPENT'S PIONEERS"
- Paired with: THE SERPENT
- Secondary: "TRAIT: THE SERPENT'S RITUALS"

**Top Card** (Location - Expansion):
- Primary: "TEMPLE OF THE LION"
- Paired with: THE LION

**Right Card** (Figure - Expansion):
- Primary: "THE DRAGON'S PARIAH"
- Paired with: THE DRAGON

**Bottom Card** (Event - Expansion):
- Primary: "THE EAGLE'S ARRIVAL"
- Paired with: THE EAGLE

**Left Card** (Material - Expansion):
- Primary: "NECTAR OF THE HERON"
- Paired with: THE HERON

This creates a rich cluster about different deities and their worldly manifestations.

## Creative Uses

### Building a Pantheon

Use deity cards to establish your world's pantheon:
1. Draw 3-7 deity cards for your main pantheon
2. Draw expansion cards for each deity to define their:
   - Sacred locations (Location + Deity)
   - Followers/champions (Figure + Deity)
   - Sacred objects (Object + Deity)
   - Holy creatures (Creature + Deity)

### Deity Domains

Combine deity primary cues with secondary cues from other cards:
- THE LION (REVELER) + Material card → What materials are associated with this god of revelry?
- THE SERPENT (NAVIGATOR) + Location card → What places does this guide deity protect?

### Religious Factions

Use faction expansion cards to create religious organizations:
- "THE TORCHBEARER'S PIONEERS" → Missionary order spreading the faith
- "CHURCH OF THE CHAMELEON" → Organized religion with hidden motives
- "THE LEECH'S EXPERIMENTS" → Cult performing dark rituals

### Divine Conflicts

Create tensions between deities:
1. Draw 2 deity cards (e.g., THE LION and THE SERPENT)
2. Draw an Event expansion card (e.g., "⚪'S REAPING")
3. Interpret: "THE LION'S REAPING" - what did this god harvest, and why does THE SERPENT oppose it?

## Link Icon System (Advanced)

The expansion uses special symbols beyond just ⚪:

- **⚪** (White Circle): Deity placeholder - replaced with deity name
- **⚫** (Black Circle): Specific card type link - draw that type
- **⚪/⚫**: Either/or - choose which link to follow

**Example**:
"TRAIT: VAST STOCKPILES OF A MATERIAL ⚪"
- The ⚪ suggests you should also draw a Material card to define what material is stockpiled

## Content Note

The Deities Expansion deals with religious themes including gods, worship, sacrifice, and divine conflict. The content is presented in a fantasy worldbuilding context. The expansion includes various deity archetypes from different mythological traditions (animal gods, cosmic entities, tricksters, etc.) Users should feel free to adapt or skip any content that doesn't fit their creative vision or comfort level.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with just the base Lore Master's Deck to learn the system, then add the expansion
2. **Mix and Match**: You don't have to use expansion cards for every slot - combine base and expansion cards
3. **Name Everything**: When you see ⚪, treat it as a creative prompt to name something important
4. **Build Connections**: Use the same deity across multiple cards to create a cohesive divine presence
5. **Secondary Cues Matter**: Don't forget to read the secondary cues on deity-paired cards - they often reference the deity
6. **Rotate Cues**: Use the < > controls to see all cues - deity references may appear on different faces

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I have to use the Deities Expansion?
A: No! The base Lore Master's Deck works perfectly on its own. The expansion is optional additional content.

### Q: Can I use deity cards without expansion variant cards?
A: Yes! Deity cards work great as standalone inspiration for creating gods, spirits, and cosmic entities in your world.

### Q: What if I draw an expansion card with multiple ⚪ symbols?
A: You can either:
- Draw multiple deity cards (one per ⚪)
- Use the same deity for all ⚪ symbols
- Mix in non-deity elements (e.g., faction names, character names)

### Q: Can I create a cluster with a deity as the center card?
A: Not in the current implementation, but this is planned for a future enhancement!

### Q: How many deity cards should I use in my world?
A: The guidebook suggests 3-7 major deities for a manageable pantheon, but you can have as many or as few as you like.

### Q: What's the difference between deity primary and secondary cues?
A: Primary cues are roles/domains/titles (REVELER, NAVIGATOR, ARCHITECT). Secondary cues are the deity's actual name (THE LION, THE SERPENT).
